# Instructions

In the workspace provided, change the size and position of element `one` using the `grid-area` property:
- Make the element stretch all the way across the grid, but only in the first row
- Make the element stretch across all the rows, but only in the first column
- Freestyle - create your own area for the element to occupy...or dare to try adding a second element and setting the placement with `grid-area` as well?
