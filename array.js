/*
Create an array called crew to organize the Serenity’s crew and set it equal to the variables below.
You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";
Then, print the crew array to the console.



 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have a variable `crew`
 * - The variable `crew` should be an array containing the Serenity\'s crew
 * - Your code should print `crew` to the console as an array. Do not iterate over the elements. 
 * - BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE PUNCTUATION AND THE EXACT WORDS TO BE PRINTED.

// Colors of the Rainbow
/*
Directions:
James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];
but James had this:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:

Remove "Blackberry"
Add "Yellow" and "Green"
Add "Purple"

 * Use only the splice() method to modify the rainbow variable:
 *  - remove "Blackberry"
 *  - add "Yellow" and "Green"
 *  - add "Purple"
 */

rainbow.splice(2, 1, 'Yellow', 'Green');
rainbow.splice(4, 0, 'Purple');
console.log(rainbow); // prints out the array to the console
