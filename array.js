// Building the Crew
/*
Create an array called crew to organize the Serenityâ€™s crew and set it equal to the variables below.
You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";
Then, print the crew array to the console.



 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
 * - Your code should have a variable `crew`
 * - The variable `crew` should be an array containing the Serenity\'s crew
 * - Your code should print `crew` to the console as an array. Do not iterate over the elements. 
 * - BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE PUNCTUATION AND THE EXACT WORDS TO BE PRINTED.

// Colors of the Rainbow
/*
Directions:
James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];
but James had this:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:

Remove "Blackberry"
Add "Yellow" and "Green"
Add "Purple"

 * Use only the splice() method to modify the rainbow variable:
 *  - remove "Blackberry"
 *  - add "Yellow" and "Green"
 *  - add "Purple"
 */

rainbow.splice(2, 1, 'Yellow', 'Green');
rainbow.splice(4, 0, 'Purple');
console.log(rainbow); // prints out the array to the console
