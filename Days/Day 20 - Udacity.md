# [9/30/2023, 15:13-16:22]
- **Today's Progress**: Continuing the course flow w/ the info on elevator pitches. Skipping around that section back into core lessons, starting back w/ #Javascript. 
- **Thoughts:** For the JS lessons the modules will have me working directly in the console tooling. i'm just gonna commit the practice work directly to my big repo instead. i'll be referencing my codecademy notes heavily during this module to not overlap notes. Still setting the foundation of the lang so not much material that's worthwhile committing atm.

# Resources
- Below are the resources that will help you put together an impressive Elevator Pitch:

# [Intro to JavaScript](https://youtu.be/EbqS33gGrj0)

## [console.log](https://youtu.be/CFhvAptATI0)
- `console.log` is used to display content to the **JavaScript console**. Run the following code in the console:
```
console.log("hiya friend!");
**Prints:** "hiya friend!"
```
- `hiya friend!` is a #String:
	- (a sequence of characters).

## Optional demo example
- Here’s a block of JavaScript code that loops through the numbers 0 through 9 and prints them out to the console:
```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

Prints:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

- This is called a #ForLoop
	- Based on this loop's settings, any code written inside the curly brackets `{...}` will be repeated 10 times.
		- In this case, `console.log` is printing out the value of `i` each time the loop runs.

# [Intro to Data Types](https://youtu.be/y9ch4F_JovU)
- #DataTypes_number:
	- The **Number** data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals.
		- Entering a number into the console will return it right back to you.
```
3 

Returns: 3
```
## Arithmetic operations
- You can also perform calculations with numbers pretty easily. Basically type out an expression the way you would type it in a calculator.
```
`3 + 2.1`

> **Returns:** 5.1
```
## Comparing numbers
- Just like in mathematics, you can compare two numbers to see if one’s greater than, less than, or equal to the other.
```
5 > 10
Returns: false

5 < 10
Returns: true

5 == 10
Returns: false
```

**Operator** | **Meaning**
--- | ---
"<"| Less than
">" | Greater than
"<=" | Less than or Equal to
">=" |Greater than or Equal to
"= =" | Equal to
"!=" | Not Equal to
- The values `true` and `false` have significant importance in JavaScript.
- These values are called #DataTypes_boolean and are another data type in JavaScript.
