- **Today's Progress**: as today's Thanksgiving i'll do a chill lesson, review yesterday's progress, then just mini-workshop state setters w/ videos
- **Thoughts:**Â happy turkey dayðŸ¦ƒ
	- 1st video i found was EXCELLENT, really filled in the gaps i had
	- the video about destructuring was also very helpful in giving me the general implementation of destructuring an object or array rather than having such be directly related to whatever usecase i'm about to work through, it made more sense here than in context of the reg module idk.
