- **Today's Progress**: Starting w/ an interview vid w/ this past sections instructor. Next is the personal blog website project. 
- **Thoughts:** fairly basic questions asked, not the most in-depth interview but a few good insights that i feel prove their value in hindsight versus when in the thick of onboarding oneself into programming. not going to redo the proj i already have pushed to #Github and hosted on #vercel. will review code line by line however. using #ChatGPT to interpret pieces of syntax is SUCH an advantage omg.

## Quality

|Success Criteria|Specifications|
|---|---|
|Valid HTML|- HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` , etc. are used to add meaning to the code.<br>- No div or section selectors are without a CSS class or id.|
|HTML Formatting Rules|- All code is lowercase<br>- The code does not have trailing white spaces.<br>- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).<br>- Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it is acceptable to put all elements in one line).<br>- When quoting attribute values, code uses consistent quotation marks (single vs. double).|
|HTML Style Rules|- HTML documents HTML5 `<!doctype html>`<br>- Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.<br>- [Optional] Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like `<` and `&`) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).|
|CSS Formatting Rules|- The code does not have trailing white spaces.<br>- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).<br>- Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.<br>- The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.<br>- Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.<br>- Code always uses a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block. Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.<br>- Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.<br>- Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).|
|CSS Style Rules|- The code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible, but as long as necessary.<br>- The code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.<br>- The code uses shorthand properties where possible.<br>- [Optional] Code omits unit specification after 0 values.<br>- [Optional] Code includes leading 0s in decimal values for readability.<br>- [Optional] Code uses 3-character hexadecimal notation where possible.<br>- [Optional] Code separates words in ID and class names by a hyphen.|
