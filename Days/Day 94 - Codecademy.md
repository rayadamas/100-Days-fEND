# Review
- Great work! You just wrote your first React form.
	- Here’s a review:
# The [state](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/state) of a React form is managed by the component, and updates are triggered by the `onChange` event.
- **Expansion:**
	- In React, the state of a form is typically managed within the component that renders the form.
		- This state management involves storing the current values of the form inputs (like text fields, checkboxes, etc.) in the component's state.
			- When a user interacts with the form, such as typing in a text field, the `onChange` event is triggered.
				- This event handler updates the component's state with the new value, ensuring that the form's state is always in sync with what the user inputs.
				- This approach is known as controlled components in React, where the form data is controlled by the React component rather than the #DoM.
- **Example:**
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyForm() {
  // Initializing state to store the value of the input field
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  // Function to handle changes in the input field
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    // Updating the state with the current value of the input field
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  // Function to handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault(); // Preventing the default form submit action
    console.log('Form submitted with input:', inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue} // The input is controlled by React state
        onChange={handleChange} // Updating state on every change
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default MyForm;
```
- **Explanation of the Code:**
	- `useState`: Initializes the state `inputValue` to store the current value of the input field.
	- `handleChange`: A function that gets called every time the input field changes (i.e., on every keystroke). It updates `inputValue` with whatever is currently in the input field.
	- `handleSubmit`: This function is called when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior and logs the current state.
	- In the `input` element:
	- `value={inputValue}` ensures that the input displays the current state.
	- `onChange={handleChange}` assigns the `handleChange` function to the input's `onChange` event, updating the state whenever the input changes.
		- The form will render with the current state of `inputValue`, and any changes made in the input field will immediately reflect in the component's state.

# The `onChange` event uses an event handler to capture changes and determine what actions to take.
- **Expansion:**
	- In React, the `onChange` event is a key mechanism for handling user inputs in form elements like:
		- input fields,
		- textareas,
		- and select menus.
			- This event gets triggered every time the value of the element changes — such as when a user types in a text field.
				- The event handler attached to the `onChange` event is a function that defines what actions should be taken in response to this change.
					- Typically, this involves updating the state of the component to reflect the new value entered by the user.
						- By doing so, the component's state remains in sync with the user's input, allowing for an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Example:**
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function UsernameForm() {
  // State to store the username
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');

  // The event handler for changes in the input field
  const handleUsernameChange = (event) => {
    // Update the state with the new input value
    setUsername(event.target.value);
  };

  // Function to handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission behavior
    console.log('Username submitted:', username);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Username:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={username} // Controlled component
          onChange={handleUsernameChange} // Event handler for onChange
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UsernameForm;
```
- **Explanation of the Code:**
	- The `useState` hook initializes `username` as an empty string to store the user input.
	- `handleUsernameChange` is the event handler function for the `onChange` event of the input field. When the user types into the input field, this function is called.
	- Inside `handleUsernameChange`, `event.target.value` holds the current value of the input field.
		- This value is used to update the `username` state with `setUsername`.
	- In the `input` element, `value={username}` binds the input's value to the `username` state, and `onChange={handleUsernameChange}` assigns the event handler to the input's `onChange` event.
	- `handleSubmit` handles the form submission, preventing the default behavior and logging the current username.
# A React form uses the State hook to store the value of the input field in the component’s state. The state can then be updated with the state setter.
- **Expansion:**
	- In React, the State hook (`useState`) is a fundamental tool for managing local state within a functional component.
		- When building forms, it's common to use this hook to store the values of input fields.
			- The initial state is set up during the hook's initialization, and React provides a setter function (typically named `setState` or something similar) for updating this state.
				- Whenever the input field changes (e.g., when a user types something), the setter function is called to update the state with the new value.
					- This ensures that the component's state is always current and reflects the user's input.
- **Example:**
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function EmailForm() {
  // State for storing the email input
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');  // Initialize with empty string

  // Event handler for email input changes
  const handleEmailChange = (event) => {
    setEmail(event.target.value);  // Update state with new email value
  };

  // Function to handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Email submitted:', email);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          type="email"
          value={email}  // Controlled component with email state
          onChange={handleEmailChange}  // Update state on input change
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default EmailForm;
```
- **Explanation of the Code:**
	- `useState('')`: Initializes the `email` state with an empty string.
	- `setEmail`: A function provided by `useState`, used to update the `email` state.
	- `handleEmailChange`: An event handler function triggered by the `onChange` event of the input field.
		- It calls `setEmail` with the new value of the input, which is accessed through `event.target.value`.
	- The `input` element is a controlled component, as its value is directly linked to the `email` state (`value={email}`), and it updates the state upon every change (`onChange={handleEmailChange}`).
	- `handleSubmit` handles the form submission. It prevents the default form submission action and logs the current state of the email.
# React components can be controlled or uncontrolled. Most React forms are controlled, as they control the input’s value with the state.
- **Expansion:**
	- In React, components can be categorized as either controlled or uncontrolled based on how they manage form data.
- **Controlled Components**:
	- In a controlled component, form data is handled by the React component's state.
		- You explicitly control the value of the form element via state and update that value based on user input using event handlers like `onChange`.
			- This approach provides direct control over the form's data and behavior, allowing for more complex interactions and validations.
- **Uncontrolled Components**:
	- Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, manage their own state internally and do not explicitly control the form data with state.
		- Instead, they rely on the DOM to handle the form data, typically using refs to interact with the form elements.
			- They are similar to traditional HTML form elements.
- Controlled components are more commonly used in React forms because they align with React's philosophy of explicit state management and declarative UI.
	- **Example of a Controlled Component:**
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function LoginForm() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');  // State for username

  const handleUsernameChange = (event) => {
    setUsername(event.target.value);  // Update state on change
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Logging in with username:', username);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Username:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={username}  // Controlled component
          onChange={handleUsernameChange}  // Handle change event
        />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default LoginForm;
```
- **Explanation:**
	- `useState`: Initializes the `username` state.
	- `handleUsernameChange`: This function updates the `username` state whenever the input field's value changes.
	- The `input` element is controlled: its value is bound to the `username` state, and it updates the state with every keystroke.
	- `handleSubmit`: Handles the form submission, preventing the default action and logging the username.
## quiz
- From scratch, build a React form for a school administrator in 'StudentForm.js'.
	- This form should have input text fields for:
		- First name Last name Age Address Homeroom class number Student ID
			- As the user inputs the student’s data in each field, the inputted values should be updated and shown on the screen for them to see that it is being received.
				- Add a radio-type input allowing the user to track a student’s favorite lunch option.
					- You can determine what lunch will be theoretically served at the school!

      ...studentData,
      [event.target.name]: event.target.value
    });
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Student Data:', studentData);

        <pre>{JSON.stringify(studentData, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}

export default StudentForm;
```
- **Explanation:**
	- The form uses a single state object `studentData` to store all the form fields.
	- `handleInputChange` is a generic change handler, updating `studentData` based on the `name` of the input and the value entered.
	- The form includes input fields for first name, last name, age, address, class number, and student ID.
	- For the favorite lunch option, radio buttons are generated for each option in the `lunchOptions` array.
	- The form displays the JSON representation of `studentData` below the form, allowing the user to see the data they are entering in real-time.
