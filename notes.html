 Spaces, tabs, line breaks = <strong>whitespace</strong>

 <h2>Breaks</h2>
<p>Mary had a little lamb<br>
 Its skin as tough as shell<br>
 And every file that toad would write<br>
 It used HTML.
</p>

 <h2><em>Markup</em></h2>
 <p>The fundametal characteristic of HTML, where the emphasis of the text is enclosed within what are
  referred to as "tags" which is the main function. These tags are the angle brackets ">".
 They are not revealed by browser. Reffered to as "non-empty" tags due to what is between the
 beginning and end tags.

 Parameters are able to be placed within the beginning tag BEFORE the ending</p>

<h2><em>Paragraphs</em></h2>
<p>This is a story...</p>
<p>Where we add paragraph tags to make it better.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a baby tiger named Talia. Talia lived in the middle of a fearsome
 jungle</p>
 <p>Talia was the most fearsome of all, though she was only a baby.</p>

 <h2><em>Elements</em></h2>
  <p>look at dis <sub>subscript</sub> text.</p>

  <p>Ayoooo<sup>this is superscript</sup>.</p>

  <em>H O W D Y</em>

 Every element starts and ends with a tag.
