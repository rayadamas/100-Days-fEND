 Spaces, tabs, line breaks = <strong>whitespace</strong>

 <h2>Breaks</h2>
<p>Mary had a little lamb<br>
 Its skin as tough as shell<br>
 And every file that toad would write<br>
 It used HTML.

 <h2><em>Markup</em></h2>
 <p>The fundametal characteristic of HTML, where the emphasis of the text is enclosed within what are
  referred to as "tags" which is the main function. These tags are the angle brackets ">".
 They are not revealed by browser. Reffered to as "non-empty" tags due to what is between the
 beginning and end tags.

 Parameters are able to be placed within the beginning tag BEFORE the ending</p>
