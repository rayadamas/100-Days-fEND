### Introduction to the Web
- The web is a vast topic encompassing various components and aspects.
	- It comprises a collection of documents primarily written in #HTML.
		- It also includes other resources such as images, videos, programs, and services that interact with HTML documents.
	- These resources are hosted on thousands of computer systems worldwide and are accessible via web browsers.
### Understanding HTML
- #HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
	- is the foundational language used to structure and write web pages.
### #URL – Web Addresses
- #URL:
	- are used to reference documents and sites on the web, functioning as addresses to locate resources on the internet.
### Hypertext System
- The web operates as a hypertext system, where:
	- documents,
	- web pages,
	- sites,
	- and web apps can contain references (hyperlinks) to other documents.
- Hyperlinks allow users to navigate from one document to another to find related information, e.g.:
	- clicking on a link in a blog post to access a related article.
- The hypertext feature is also utilized when a web page embeds images, videos, or pieces of code, linking to other information or resources.
- The web's structure revolves around this system, where documents and data objects interlink in a standardized manner, facilitating easy navigation and access to information.
## Practical Application
- Participants will apply the knowledge gained to take notes and convert these notes into a functional web page, thereby implementing the concepts learned practically.

## Web Browsers and Servers Interaction
1. **Introduction**
    - Web browsers facilitate the retrieval of web pages, primarily through communication with servers over the internet.
    - These servers are not different from a personal computer but have special programs running to respond to browsers' requests.
2. **How Servers Work**
    - Servers host files or documents that can be linked or accessed through different platforms (e.g., a video hosted on YouTube can be linked to and viewed from Udacity's website).
    - Web pages can consolidate various resources like videos, images, fonts, or codes, which might be located on the same or different web servers.
3. **Communication Protocol**
    - The communication between browsers and servers follows the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** #HTTP.
    - Web addresses usually commence with #HTTP or #HTTPS, instructing the browser on the communication modality with the server.
    - During the web page creation, HTTP isn't initially necessary; instead, creators can save and view the web page as a file on their computer.
    - To make the web page public, it should be uploaded to a server.
4. **HTML: The Backbone of Web Pages**
    - HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language:
	    - is used to delineate the structure and content of web pages.
		    - A server sends an HTML file as the initial data to a browser when a website is accessed.
		    - The HTML file contains technical details instructing the browser on how to construct and display the page.
5. **Building and Viewing a Web Page**
    - Initially, creators can build and view web pages directly from their computers ==without== involving a server or HTTP.
    - Web browsers can display documents saved on the **local** computer and from the internet.
    - For public viewing, the web page needs to be uploaded onto a server, enabling access to users globally.
6. **Tools and Resources**
    - To explore the technicalities of an HTML file, one can utilize programmer's tools which allow a detailed view of the structural elements and instructions contained in the file.
    - Understanding these details can assist in the efficient creation and troubleshooting of web pages.
7. **Conclusion**
    - Understanding the dynamics between web browsers and servers, including the role of HTML, is vital in web page creation.
    - Aspiring web developers should acquaint themselves with the protocols and languages that govern web page structure and functionality.

1. **Introduction**
	- HTML as a starting point in programming.
	- Quick feedback through immediate visual results on the web browser.
	- Importance of focusing on big concepts during the lesson.
2. **Concept 1: Syntax**
	- #Syntax:
		- The set of grammar rules in a language.
	- Similarities with natural languages in terms of having specific grammar rules.
	- Importance of adhering to syntax to avoid errors.
	- Learning through explicit rules and examples.
3. **Concept 2: Formalism**
	- Often humorously described as "computers are stupid."
	- Computers interpret code literally without room for inference or autocorrect.
	- Significance of accurate spelling and punctuation.
	- Example:
		- The repercussions of a typo in HTML tagging (title vs. tilte).
4. **Concept 3:** #Nesting 
	- An advanced aspect of syntax prevalent in all programming languages.
	- Refers to the structured embedding of code segments within others.
	- Analogy:
		- Nested conversations in human language narrations.
	- Promise of guidance and pointers during instances of nesting in lessons.
5. **Support and Resources**
	- Availability of numerous resources to aid learning.
	- Emphasis on the importance of documentation: manuals and tutorials.
	- Example resource:
		- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for HTML learning.
	- Encouragement to explore beyond provided resources, utilizing search engines for additional help.
6. **Conclusion**
	- Encouragement to leverage the vast amount of available resources.
	- The learner is part of a global community of coding enthusiasts.

# [Text Editors and Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_gB9yRN7IY&t=3s)
## Overview
- HTML documents and various programs are written in text files.
- Text files contain characters:
	- letters,
	- numbers,
	- symbols,
	- spaces, etc.,
		- but lack special typography or embedded media.
- Despite seeming limiting, text files are versatile and can be utilized in various applications, including programming and data analysis.
## Characteristics of Text Files
1. **Simplicity**:

	- Webpages can display media by incorporating text-based addresses in the HTML code, which browsers then use to download and display the correct media files.
- **Editing**:
	- Programmers' text editors might exhibit syntax highlighting, facilitating correct coding by displaying different text elements in various colors. This is a feature of the editor and not a property of the text file itself.
## File Naming Conventions
- **File Extensions**:
	- Utilized to indicate file types, aiding in the appropriate handling by editors and browsers.
- **HTML Files**:
	- Typically have ".html" extensions.
- **Purpose**:
	- Help in the correct interpretation and processing of files by different programs.
## Conclusion
- Text files, characterized by their simplicity and flexibility, are fundamental in creating HTML documents and a myriad of other applications.
- Despite appearing plain, text files can facilitate complex operations, including building intricate web pages and enabling diverse programming projects.

## Start a `notes.html` file!
It's time to create an HTML file! You can do this either using the text editor you installed **or** the workspace provided below.

- [ ] Specifically, let's create a file called `notes.html` that you can use to take notes throughout this course.

- Taking notes in this file will serve two purposes:
	- First, as you go through the course, you can test out your knowledge of HTML, by writing HTML code in this file and displaying it in your browser.
	- And second, the act of writing down the ideas will help you remember them better — and if you do forget something, you can simply look at your notes!

**Later on, at the very end of this lesson, you'll submit your notes file to our automatic grading system and we'll check your HTML code!**
