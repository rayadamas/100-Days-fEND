			<p>The Amur Tiger is the only subspecies of tiger that can survive in extremely cold areas.
				It is has developed certain physical characteristics that enable it to endure the cold
				climate of its habitat. The tiger has a thick layer of fat that insulates the body against heat loss.
				Additionally, the thick, dense fur that covers its body keeps the animal warm, especially when it is
				extremely cold. The Siberia tiger is always on the move and does not idle for long. The constant
				movement ensures that the body generates a lot of heat to keep it warm.</p>
